GTA:SA Positional audio plugin for Mumble
=============

Installation
-------

* Place in your mumble plugin files in the /plugins/ folder
* in the mumble window, go to configure->settings->plugins. (If you don't see this tab, check the "Advanced" checkbox)
* Check "Link to game and transmit position", and check "Enabled" on GTA:SA:MP
* Restart mumble.
* if it worked, when you start GTA:SA it will say "GTA:SA:MP linked" in the mumble chat.


Notes
-------

* When talking to someone, for it to work, they must have the plugin installed as well.
* if you're connected to different servers, it will still transmit positional audio
